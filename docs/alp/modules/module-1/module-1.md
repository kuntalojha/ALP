# Module 1

## I. Introduction to Linux: 
 
 
Linux is a Unix-like computer operating system assembled under the model of free and open 
source software development and distribution. The defining component of Linux is the Linux 
kernel, an operating system kernel first released 5 October 1991 by Linus Torvalds. 
 
Linux was originally developed as a free operating system for Intel x86-based personal 
computers. It has since been ported to more computer hardware platforms than any other 
operating system. It is a leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as 
mainframe computers and supercomputers more than 90% of today's 500 fastest 
supercomputers run some variant of Linux, including the 10 fastest. 

Linux also runs on 
embedded systems (devices where the operating system is typically built into the firmware and 
highly tailored to the system) such as mobile phones, tablet computers, network routers, 
televisions and video game consoles; the Android system in wide use on mobile devices is 
built on the Linux kernel.

## Linux
- Linux is a free and open-source, Unix like operating system.
- It is primarily operated through command-line interfaces, but also supports graphical user interfaces.

5. Flexibility
6. Compatibility
7. Choice
8. First and easy to install
9. Full use of hard disk
10. Multitasking
11. Security
12. Open-Source

 
## Basic Features  
Following are some of the important features of Linux Operating System.  
1. **Portable** - Portability means softwares can works on different types of hardwares in 
same way. Linux kernel and application programs supports their installation on any kind 
of hardware platform.
 
2. **Open Source** - Linux source code is freely available and it is community based 
development project. Multiple teams works in collaboration to enhance the capability 
of Linux operating system and it is continuously evolving.

3. **Multi-User** - Linux is a multiuser system means multiple users can access 
system resources like memory/ ram/ application programs at same time.

4. **Multiprogramming** - Linux is a multiprogramming system means multiple 
applications can run at same time.

5. **Hierarchical File System** - Linux provides a standard file structure in which system files/ user files are arranged. 
 
6. **Shell** - Linux provides a special interpreter program which can be used to execute 
commands of the operating system. It can be used to do various types of operations, call 
application programs etc.

7. **Security** - Linux provides user security using authentication features like password 
protection/ controlled access to specific files/ encryption of data


## Linux Advantages  

1. **Low cost:** You don’t need to spend time and money to obtain licenses since Linux andmuch 
of its software come with the GNU General Public License. You can start to workimmediately 
without worrying that your software may stop working anytime because thefree trial version 
expires. Additionally, there are large repositories from which you canfreely download high 
quality software for almost any task you can think of. 
 
2. **Stability:** Linux doesn’t need to be rebooted periodically to maintain performance levels. 
Itdoesn’t freeze up or slow down over time due to memory leaks and such. Continuous up
times of hundreds of days (up to a year or more) are not uncommon. 
 
3. **Performance:** Linux provides persistent high performance on workstations and 
onnetworks. It can handle unusually large numbers of users simultaneously, and can make 
oldcomputers sufficiently responsive to be useful again. 
 
4. **Network friendliness:** Linux was developed by a group of programmers over the 
Internet and has therefore strong support for network functionality; client and server 
systems can be easily set up on any computer running Linux. It can perform tasks such as 
network backups faster and more reliably than alternative systems. 
 
5. **Flexibility:** Linux can be used for high performance server applications, desktop 
applications, and embedded systems. You can save disk space by only installing the 
components needed for a particular use. You can restrict the use of specific computers by 
installing for example only selected office applications instead of the whole suite. 

6. **Compatibility:** It runs all common Unix software packages and can process all common file 
formats. 

7. **Choice:** The wide variety of Linux distributions offers users plenty of options. Each distribution is developed and maintained by a different organization, allowing you to choose the one that best suits your needs. Despite the differences, all distributions share the same core functionalities, so most software runs seamlessly across them.

 
8. **Fast and easy installation:** Most Linux distributions come with user-friendly installation 
and setup programs. Popular Linux distributions come with tools that make installation of 
additional software very user friendly as well. 
 
9. **Full use of hard disk:** Linux continues work well even when the hard disk is almost full. 

10. **Multitasking:** Linux is designed to do many things at the same time; e.g., a large printing 
job in the background won’t slow down your other work. 
 
11. **Security:** Linux is one of the most secure operating systems. “Walls” and flexible file 
access permission systems prevent access by unwanted visitors or viruses. Linux users have 
to option to select and safely download software, free of charge, from online repositories 
containing thousands of high quality packages. No purchase transactions requiring credit card 
numbers or other sensitive personal information are necessary. 
 
12. **Open Source:** If you develop software that requires knowledge or modification of the 
operating system code, Linux’s source code is at your fingertips. Most Linux applications 
are Open Source as well.
